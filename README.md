# TextBasedGame
This is a project I created after learning Java Basic as a beginner this project is a great way to start my journey.
It wasn't overly challenging and I am a big fans of adventure games. This doesn’t involve any Graphical User Interface (GUI) 
as it’s text-based, but it’s still a fun game to create with Java and even more fun to play.

The premise of the game is that the main character enters a dungeon and chances across 4 different types of enemies at random: 
a skeleton, a zombie, a warrior, and an assassin. 
The hero enters the dungeon with 3 health potions and could potentially get more when a monster is defeated. 
At each turn, the user can either attack, use a potion, or run.
